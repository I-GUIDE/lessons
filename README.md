# Convergence Curriculum Lessons for Geospatial Data Science

The Convergence Curriculum for Geospatial Data Science is an integrative framework to prepare next-generation students and current-generation scholars and professionals to tackle complex, convergent problems. 

At its base, the multi-tiered curriculum contains five Foundational Knowledge Threads that establish a common basis for individuals from diverse backgrounds. Each of these threads draws from its own relevant modes of thinking, data, methods, and tools & cyberinfrastructure.

Next, individuals integrate skills, knowledge, methods, and technologies as they move up through Knowledge Connections and Knowledge Frames. As the figure indicates, the Knowledge Connections reflect particular contributions from the Foundational Knowledge Threads.

Finally, the pinnacle of the curriculum is Knowledge Convergence, which blends the previous competencies with pre-existing domain knowledge.

The lessons in this repository correspond to these various Knowledge Threads, Connections, and Frames.
